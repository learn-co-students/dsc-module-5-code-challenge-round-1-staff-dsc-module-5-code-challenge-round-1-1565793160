    "Welcome to your Module 5 assessment! You will be tested for your understanding of concepts as well as your ability to solve problems that have been covered in class and in the curriculum. Use any libraries that you want to solve the problems in the assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will have up to two hours to complete this assessment. Remember to not get stuck on any one problem for too long!\n",
    "\n",
    "The sections of the assessment are:\n",

    "* Decision Trees\n",
    "* Ensemble Models\n",
    "* Principal Components Analysis\n",
    "* Clustering\n",

    "1) Demonstrate how regression decision trees make predictions. How does it differ from a linear regression?  \n",
    "2) Fit a Decision Tree model and make a prediction.  \n",
    "3) Obtain feature importances to determine the most important factors in your prediction."

    "* Describe the difference between Random Forests and Boosting  \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Explain how the Random Forest algorithm differs from the Boosting algorithm.    \n",
    "2) What makes a Random Forest \"random\"? How does it differ than decision trees?  \n",

    "\n",
    "1) Use principal component analysis on a dataset to transform features --> use those features as the input features to another machine learning model.  \n",

    "3) Have students explain how clusters are evaluated.  \n",
